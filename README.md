A C++17 port of [triangle](https://github.com/esimov/triangle), just to understand some C++ concepts a little better.
Trias is a tool to create image arts using the [delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) technique. It takes an image as input and it converts to abstract image composed of tiles of triangles.
